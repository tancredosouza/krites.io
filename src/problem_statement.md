### Fibonnacci Sequence

#### Definition

The Fibonnacci sequence is defined as follows:

```
- fib(0) = 0
- fib(1) = 1
- fib(n) = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2), for n > 1
```

##### Input

You are given a non-negative integer `N`, which defines the number of test cases.
For each test case, consisting of a non-negative integer `i`, you must calculate `fib(i)`.

##### Output

Every `i`-th line should contain the `i`-th Fibonnacci number followed by a line break.
