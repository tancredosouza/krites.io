# Fibonnacci numbers

Given `N` numbers, return the correspondent fibonnacci number.

## Definition

The Fibonnacci sequence is defined as follows

```
- fib(0) = 0
- fib(1) = 1
- fib(n) = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2), for n > 1
```

You're given an integer `N` representing the number of fibonnacci numbers to be calculated.
Then, `N` lines follow.
For each number `i`, calculate the `i`-th Fibonnacci number.

For each number, your output should be the `i`-th Fibonnacci number followed by a line break.
